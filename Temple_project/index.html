          The Ram Janmabhoomi is a sacred location that must not be missed.
          According to Hindu tradition, the Ram Janmabhoomi, which translates as
          "Ram's Birthplace," is believed to have been the location of Lord
          Ram's birth. According to the Indian epic Ramayana, Ram, Lord Vishnu's
          seventh avatar, has grown up beside the Sarayu River, which flows
          through Ayodhya, where he is said to have been born. The Ram
          Janmabhoomi land, which had been a source of contention for decades,
          was finally transferred to a trust by the Supreme Court of India to
          construct the Ram Temple. The planned design for the temple is
          abundant and spectacular in its scale and scope. The Prime Minister of
          India, Narendra Modi, held the groundbreaking ceremony to lay the
          foundation stone for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on the 5th of August in
          the year 2020. The Ram Janmabhoomi site was the former location of the
          Babri Masjid, which is now a national monument. It is claimed that the
          Mughals razed a Hindu sanctuary to construct this mosque at the site
          of Lord Ram's birthplace. In 1992, Hindu nationalists demolished the
          Babri Masjid, igniting a sequence of deadly riots throughout India
          that continued for years. In October 2019, a Supreme Court panel of
          five justices ruled that the land be transferred to a trust to
          construct the Ram Temple. The Sunni Waqf Board was also allocated 5
          acres of property to construct a mosque.

        <p>
          Hanuman Garhi is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu God Hanuman
          located in Sai Nagar. The temple dates back to the 10th century. In
          Ayodhya, it is considered one of the most significant temples since it
          is usual to visit Hanuman Garhi before visiting the Ram Temple. It is
          claimed that Lord Hanuman still resides in this temple and protects
          Ayodhya. The hilltop temple's 76-staircase route to the door is a work
          of art. A 6-inch-tall Hanuman statue stands amid a panoramic picture
          of the surrounding hills and is housed within the panoramic view. The
          main temple's inner cave is embellished with countless sculptures of
          Lord Hanuman and his mother, Maa Anjani, worshiped here. Each year,
          thousands of pilgrims go to the Hanuman Garhi to commemorate the birth
          of Lord Ram and Lord Hanuman on their respective feast days, Ram
          Navami and Hanuman Jayanti.

        <p>
          Located in Tulsi Nagar, near the Ram Janmabhoomi, the Kanak Bhawan is
          erected in the northeastern part of the complex. This temple, also
          known as Sone-ka-Ghar, was built in 1891 and is dedicated to the Hindu
          god Lord Rama and his wife, Goddess Sita. The sanctum sanctorum of
          Kanak Bhawan, also known as the Golden Palace, has three
          golden-crowned statues of the two gods under a silver dome, which
          represents the palace of gold (Garbagriha). It is said that Kaikeyi,
          Rama's stepmother, gave this temple to Rama and Sita as a gift to
          commemorate their marriage. Following a planned refurbishment during
          Vikramaditya's reign, the current location was completely renovated by
          Vrishbhanu Kunwari, who also designed the original structure. The Sri
          Vrishbhan Dharma Setu Trust Private Limited is presently in charge of
          the administration of this temple in the Bundela style.
